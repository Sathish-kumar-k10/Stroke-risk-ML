# Stroke Risk Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a person is at risk of having a stroke based on medical information.

## Dataset
The dataset contains health features such as:
- Age
- Cholesterol
- Blood pressure
- BMI
- Smoking habit

The target column indicates:
- 1 → Stroke risk
- 0 → No stroke risk

## What the project does
- Loads and cleans the medical dataset  
- Removes rows with missing values  
- Selects useful features  
- Trains a classification model  
- Evaluates performance using accuracy and other metrics  
- Predicts stroke risk for new patients  

## How to run
1. Install required libraries  
2. Open the notebook:
